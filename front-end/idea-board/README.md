## About Frontend

At ContentCal we use Typescript as a common language between the Front & Back end technology stack. Our systems will continue to evolve as we grow and scale, and are always looking for new innovative solutions to solve problems and build better products.

Our app uses state management, REST and GraphQl in the data layer.

We are currently working with...
 * Typescript throughout the codebase
 * Nx build
 * Angular 10+
 * NGRX
 * Apollo 
 * GraphQL

## What we're looking for

Please dont feel that you need to use all the technologies listed, however it would be ideal to see Angular and NGRX usage

 * A stylish solution with unit test coverage in TypeScript
 * Clean, concise code
 * an appreciation of design
 * A detailed README
 * A live site we can see (if possible)
 * Add you code to your favorite VCS and ping us your solution
